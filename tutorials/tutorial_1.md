<h3>Getting started</h3>

<p>To build a site, we will create a number of CSS, images and HTML files, which we call resource files. Using the XPE Cloud IDE, you can build and deploy your web application all in one environment. So, before we start, point your browser to <a href="http://ide.softtouchit.com"
        target="ide">XPE Cloud IDE</a> and register yourself.</p>
<h3>Tutorial 1: Hello World</h3>

<p>Once you have registered an account, just login, click on the IDE link and your browser will be transformed into a powerful IDE. Right-click on the left side of the IDE as shown in the figure below and select "New Project".</p>
<img src="/images/newProject.png"
    alt="new project" height="400px" />
<p>Fill in your project name and click "OK". Your new project will now appear in the left panel. Now, the project will appear on the left panel of the IDE. Open the project and then click "Build" followed by "Preview". Your browser will display a page similar
        to the following:</p>
<img src="/images/hello.png" alt="new project" height="400px" />
<p>Congratulations! You have now built your very first application using XPE.</p>
<p>You might have noticed that the following dir structure was created for you:</p>	
    
<pre>
      src
	    content
		css
		fonts
        images
		js
		ms
		templates
</pre>
	
<p>All files created by us will be stored under the src dir.  The following folders are created under the src dir:</p>
	
<ol>
<li>content: to store static contents</li>
<li>css: to store css files</li>
<li>fonts: to store font files</li>
<li>images: to store image files</li>
<li>js: all your javascript files should be put here</li>
<li>ms: backend services running on a messaging server</li>
<li>templates: template files</li>
</ol>
	
<p>You can open a folder by clicking on the triangle next to the folder.  Clicking a file will open the file.  Depending on the file type, the IDE will open
	    the file with the most suitable editor.
</p>
	
<p>Try explore all content and templates folders and see if you can add some text to the page we have just visited.  Don't forget to build after changing your
	    files.
